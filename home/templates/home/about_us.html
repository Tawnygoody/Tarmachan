                    Tarmachan was born on the rugged mountain slopes of the Scottish Highlands wilderness. It's not our place to tell people to go to the wild places
                    and mountains. It's our mission to provide our athletes and explorers the very best equipment in order to do so. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Tarmachan" is the Gaelic word for Ptarmigan. These little birds, only found on the high slopes of the Highlands, are master's of disguise - 
                    matching its Highland surroundings perfectly by turning snow-white in winter and rock-grey in summer.

                    Coincidentally it was on the slopes of Meall Nan Tarmachan that a walking enthusiast spotted a congregation of 
                    Ptarmigans and resolved to follow his passions to found a store for the modern day mountaineer.
